# homelab-infra
Code & files I need to make my homelab work.

# Why should you not attempt to do things my way?

It is not designed for reuse, it is designed to work, and to keep all of my infra-related stuff in one place.

Other people have set up a more approachable/reusable way of doing things:
- [Onedr0p's flux template](https://github.com/onedr0p/flux-cluster-template).
- [Traefik Turkey](https://github.com/traefikturkey/onramp), maintained by members of [TechnoTim](https://www.technotim.live/)'s community
